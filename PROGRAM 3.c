TOWER OF HANOI

AIM : To implement the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion and display the sequence of moves required to transfer disks from source to destination.

ALGORITHM :
1.Start
2.Read number of disks n
3.Call function toh(n, source, destination, auxiliary)
4.In function:
 - If n == 1
 - Move disk from source to destination
5.Else
 - Move n-1 disks from source to auxiliary using destination
 - Move nth disk from source to destination
 - Move n-1 disks from auxiliary to destination using source
 - Repeat until all disks are moved
6.Stop

SOURCE CODE :

void toh(int, char, char, char);
void (int n, char x, char y, char z)
{ If(n==1)
{ printf(“\nDisk %d-%c to %c”, n,x,y);
} else {
toh(n-1, x,z,y); 
printf(“\nDisk %d,%c to %c”,n, x,y);
toh(n-1,z,y,x); } void main()
{
Int n;
printf(“Enter the no of Disks”);
scanf(“%d”,&n); 
toh(n,’A’,’B’,’C’);
}


RESULT :
The program successfully:
 - Solves the Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion
 - Displays all steps required to move n disks
 - Demonstrates recursive problem-solving
  Number of moves required = 2ⁿ − 1
